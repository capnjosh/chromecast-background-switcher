chromecast-background-switcher
==============================

This is inspired by the Chromecast screensaver. I wanted to create an extensible
plugin I can use to render the beautiful images by the screensaver.

Thanks to [https://github.com/dconnolly/Chromecast-Backgrounds]
(https://github.com/dconnolly/Chromecast-Backgrounds) I'm able to get a list of
images.
